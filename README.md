# Learning Go #

This is a collection of simple projects that I've been working on to learn golang.

## Projects ##

1. Hello World

   This project is as simple as it protrays itself to be. This go module starts up a new
   HTTP REST server with the endpoint `/test` and returns Hello World.

2. File Server

   This project creates a FileServer using the built in FileServer provided by `net/http`.
   The server returns image files from the `static` directory, locating the directory using
   the `osext` module after the project is build to an executable.

3. Binary Tree

   This file defines a binary tree structure including functions for
   updating and deleting elements in the tree.
